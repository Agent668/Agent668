# Hey, I'm Agent ðŸ‘‹

I'm a gamer and a programmer.
I also make websites and I love basically anything tech related.

Ngl I'm not the best programmer but I'd like to think im above average :)

Programming Languages: Python, Lua(still learning)


I live in Slovenia (EU)

Languages: English, Slovenian


# Current projects:
## Sticky Notes
An app simmilar to the microsoft sticky notes but made in python(cuz idk other languages..)
Kinda bad rn but I'll make it better.
Key feature I will add later and the reason I am making it is the app allways apearing on top.
(sticky notes on ms store doesnt do that and I feel like its the most imp. feature for sticky notes)
## Roblox games
Can't rly tell the title yet since I haven't even started working on it yet.
Currently im still learning Lua so I'm just experimenting for now.
